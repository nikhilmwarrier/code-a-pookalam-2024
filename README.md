# Code a Pookalam 2024: My submission

![Pookalam](./nikhilmwarrier_2024_CET.png)

I used [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for this. This is the first time I'm using
this library so I might have missed a few tricks here.

To see the pookalam in action, open `index.html` in web browser.

(Or copy/paste everything in the `nikhilmwarrier_2024_CET.js` file into the
[p5.js web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/)).
